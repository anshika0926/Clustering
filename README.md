# Clustering
In this repo we will be discussing the clustering techniques such as K-means, DBSCAN, K-modes etc.

In this notebooke I have discussed the baisc steps to be followed, for obtaining the clusters like:

1.Standardization: Its a type of Feature scaling, to make the data uniform such that columns with higher value and the columns with lower value can be set to same range.
2.Elbow method: used in clustering analysis to detrmine the number of clusters we can make in the dataset
3.Checking Outliers through visualization (noise in the dataset)
4.Clustering and (main filtering approach of data).
